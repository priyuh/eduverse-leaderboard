# Scaling Analysis: EduVerse Leaderboard for 10,000+ Users

## ðŸŽ¯ Scaling Strategy for 10,000+ Users

To scale the EduVerse Leaderboard system for 10,000+ concurrent users, I would implement a **microservices architecture** with **horizontal scaling**, **caching layers**, and **database optimization**. The current monolithic structure would be decomposed into specialized services: a **challenge management service**, a **scoring engine service**, a **leaderboard service**, and a **user management service**. 

**Database scaling** would involve migrating from SQLite to **PostgreSQL with read replicas** and implementing **Redis caching** for frequently accessed leaderboard data. The scoring algorithm would be moved to a **dedicated microservice** with **queue-based processing** using **Apache Kafka** to handle batch score calculations asynchronously.

**Frontend scaling** would utilize **CDN distribution** (CloudFlare/AWS CloudFront) and **server-side rendering** with **Next.js** to reduce client-side load. **API rate limiting** and **authentication middleware** would prevent abuse, while **horizontal pod autoscaling** on **Kubernetes** would automatically scale services based on demand. This architecture would support **10,000+ concurrent users** with **sub-100ms response times** and **99.9% uptime**.
